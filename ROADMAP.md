# Roadmap — AI Job-Application Copilot
## Now
- JD URL fetch + cleaner (focus Responsibilities/Requirements)
- Truth checks: highlight unsupported claims before copy
- Export: `.docx` with shortlisted bullets
## Next
- JD coverage metric (% reqs touched) + tiny dashboard
- PII redaction preprocessor on by default
- `--outdir` flag + auto-run archiving
## Later
- Streamlit UI (paste JD/resume → shortlist + export)
- Model-agnostic provider interface (swap OpenAI/Anthropic/local)
- Golden-questions service with pass/fail history
